OVERVIEW:

GBench is a benchmarking module for Groovy. It allows you to compare the
performance of programs.

GBench has two features: Benchmark Builder and Benchmark Transformation.

Benchmark Builder allows you to correctly benchmark programs. Groovy is a
difficult language to accurately benchmark. Method caching, dynamic
optimization and garbage collection by JVM, there are many factors that
interfere measurement. You can resolve the issues by using BenchmarkBuilder.

for understanding what the "correctly" means.

Benchmark Transformation allows you to measure methodsâ€™ execution time
without additional code.
